# sylvite

An effort to make a nice collection of higher-level functionality and utility atop ggez.

See https://github.com/ggez/ggez/issues/235 for discussion.

Things we definitely want:

 * Resource management
 * Physics/collision engine
 * Particle system
 * ECS
 * Controller support (I know we have some already, not sure if it still needs work)
 * Scene management
 * GUI
 * Awesome sprites (look at cocos2d for API)

Things we probably want:

 * Scripting support
 * Networking support
 * Tile maps

Libraries that will probably be useful:

 * warmy (resources)
 * ncollide/nphysics (collision, physics)
 * ggez-goodies (scene management, camera, particles)
 * specs (ECS)
 * aseprite (sprite loader)
 * tiled (tile maps)
 * conrod (GUI)
 * hlua/rlua (scripting)
